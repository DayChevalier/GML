GameMaker Studio GML code

-----------------------
As the name says, I've played around quite a bit in GameMaker Studio. It's GameMaker Language (GML) is an imperative, dynamically typed scripting language similar to JavaScript and C-like languages.

The language appears to try and accommodate different programming backgrounds and styles - BASIC/Lua style "and" / "or" keywords can be used interchangeably with C-style "&&" / "||" operators; parentheses around conditions in if-statements and loops can be omitted; semicolons are largely optional, (insertion happens at the end of statement; compile error is raised in case of ambiguity).

The language's default mode of operation on native platforms is via a stack machine.

As I first began playing with GameMaker Studio (with a lack of graphical assets to play with), I stretched my first muscles by attempting to recreate Nintendo's (and Capcom's) Gameboy Color action adventure video game "The Legend of Zelda: Oracles of Ages" in the GameMaker engine. Using sprites and graphical assets pre-ripped by online communities, I was able to get a basic 'game' running. From there, (using this half-Zelda game as a base) I've experimented with different video game interaction and GUI concepts to see how I would go about coding them. This has been a fun series of experiments.
