# GML
GameMaker Studio GML code

As the name says, I've playe daround quite a bit in GameMaker Studio. It's GameMaker Language (GML) is an imperative, dynamically typed scripting language similar to JavaScript and C-like languages.

The language appears to try and accommodate different programming backgrounds and styles - BASIC/Lua style "and" / "or" keywords can be used interchangeably with C-style "&&" / "||" operators; parentheses around conditions in if-statements and loops can be omitted; semicolons are largely optional, (insertion happens at the end of statement; compile error is raised in case of ambiguity).

The language's default mode of operation on native platforms is via a stack machine.
